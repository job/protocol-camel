# dns camel
Goal is to get a place where we can gather DNS relevant RFCs and drafts,
including page numbers and number of 'MUST' and 'SHOULD' statements.

Page is live on http://instituut.net/~job/bgp-camel/

# Original README

The origin camel viewer was created by Bert Hubert at https://github.com/ahuPowerDNS/protocol-camel

## How you can help
In various ways:

 * The source file [dns-rfcs.js] is known to not list all DNS relevant RFCs
 * The output is pretty ugly, CSS help is welcome!
 * There is no infrastructure yet to track drafts
